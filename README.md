# Hotel Bookings Prediction - Cancelled vs Non cancelled Bookings


## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for hotel booking cancellations using a dataset that included various features such as lead time, deposit type, average daily rate (ADR), and others.





## Objectives
This project involves:

- Predicting Customer Cancellations: Developing a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will cancel their hotel booking.

- Data Understanding and Exploration: Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to prepare it for modeling.

- Model Building and Evaluation: Developing and evaluating five different machine learning models:

    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Untuned Decision Tree
    - Tuned Decision Tree
    - Untuned Random Forest
    - Tuned Random Forest
- Model Selection: Identifying the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
